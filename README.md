# Flowchart_generator-
The code uses OpenAI's GPT-3 API to generate a text-based representation of a flowchart based on a given task description. It prompts the user to input a task description, sends that prompt to the GPT-3 API, and receives a response containing the generated flowchart text representation, which is then printed as the output.
